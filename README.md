D.O.M 27 Synth
My project is a fully DIY & anaglouge modular synth based on the eurorack system. It features 4 fundemental components of synthesis - a VCO, LFO, VCF & VCA. Because it is a modular synth & based on eurorack, this means that I can create more modules when I please to expand
the functionality of my synth. 

I made this my project is due to my passion for synth music and a want to learn to electronics. This was perfect as I could learn some basics of anaglouge electronics while also creating a useable, musical instrument. It was also perfect because modular synthesis is 
typically a very expensive hobby to get into.
