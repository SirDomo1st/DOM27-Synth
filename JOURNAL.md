June 14th: Started my research
I started to learn about analouge VCO's (voltage controlled oscialtors). I watched some youtube videos - here are some things I learnt:
-The components that go into making a square wave and sawtooth wave oscilator
-How electrical charge can move around a circuit to create pitch and noise

I have decided I am going to start with a VCO module with 2 types of tone, pusle and saw.
I am also keeping in mind other modules I will want to make in the future, such as:
-VCA
-Envelope
-LFO

Here are some videos I watched:
-[This 4 part series on VCO's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBatvo8bCa4)
-[Understanding Voltage Controlled Oscillators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuo6Q0LuHNM&t=285s)
Total time spent: 1h

June 14th: Designed first mock of circuit diagram
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49c6159-f723-4ca2-8aff-d6fe6d3145dd)
-This is cicuit diagram for my VCO
-I also learnt about different types of components that go into making a circuit
