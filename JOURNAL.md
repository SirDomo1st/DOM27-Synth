June 14th: Started my research
I started to learn about analouge VCO's (voltage controlled oscialtors). I watched some youtube videos - here are some things I learnt:
-The components that go into making a square wave and sawtooth wave oscilator
-How electrical charge can move around a circuit to create pitch and noise

I have decided I am going to start with a VCO module with 2 types of tone, pusle and saw.
I am also keeping in mind other modules I may want to make in the future, such as:
-VCA
-Envelope
-LFO
-Squencer (maybe?)
-VCF
-Mixer

Here are some videos I watched:
-[This 4 part series on VCO's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBatvo8bCa4)
-[Understanding Voltage Controlled Oscillators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuo6Q0LuHNM&t=285s)

-This is cicuit diagram for my VCO
-I also learnt about different types of components that go into making a circuit

June 16th: Added PMW modifcation and started to think about power
I found a circuit design for Pulse Width Modulation. I think this would be a good edition to my first VCO so I added it

I also did some research into how to power my module and I added this

I also picked the name for my VCO - The ✨"Klajdiscope"✨

June 18th: Figuring out layout of module
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7e92c2a-2a81-420e-85cf-6ebfada003bd)
I spent quite a significant amount of time working on where everything should go, so I can make it as useable and understandable as possible.
I also spent some time figuring out what I actually need phyiscal inputs and potentiometers for on the module. I concluded that R3, R5, R7 & R9 do not need dials, as they have constant resistance

June 21st: Footprints and Finalising layout
The first thing I had to do was assign footprints for each component in my circuit, so that when they are placed on the PCB they have the right holes. Because this was my first time, this took me a fair while as I wanted to make sure that I was doing everything right.

After that, I copied the layout I had made previously by dragging the footprints around. This is what I was left with:
