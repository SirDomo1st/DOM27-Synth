June 14th: Started my research
I started to learn about analouge VCO's (voltage controlled oscialtors). I watched some youtube videos - here are some things I learnt:
-The components that go into making a square wave and sawtooth wave oscilator
-How electrical charge can move around a circuit to create pitch and noise

I have decided I am going to start with a VCO module with 2 types of tone, pusle and saw.
I am also keeping in mind other modules I may want to make in the future, such as:
-VCA
-Envelope
-LFO
-Squencer (maybe?)
-VCF
-Mixer

Here are some videos I watched:
-[This 4 part series on VCO's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBatvo8bCa4)
-[Understanding Voltage Controlled Oscillators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuo6Q0LuHNM&t=285s)

-This is cicuit diagram for my VCO
-I also learnt about different types of components that go into making a circuit

June 16th: Added PMW modifcation and started to think about power
I found a circuit design for Pulse Width Modulation. I think this would be a good edition to my first VCO so I added it

I also did some research into how to power my module and I added this

I also pick the name for my VCO - The ✨"Klajdiscope"✨

June 18th: Figuring out layout of module
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7e92c2a-2a81-420e-85cf-6ebfada003bd)
I spent quite a significant amount of time working on where everything should go, so I can make it as useable and understandable as possible.
I also spent some time figuring out what I actually need phyiscal inputs and potentiometers for on the module. I concluded that R3, R5, R7 & R9 do not need dials, as they have constant resistance
